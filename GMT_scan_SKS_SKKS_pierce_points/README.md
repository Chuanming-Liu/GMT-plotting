## GMT_scan_SKS_SKKS_pierce_points

Script and files for reproducing _SKS_-_SKKS_ pierce point figures of **_Grund & Ritter (2019)_**. For further information, results and interpretations, please feel free to read our paper.

To generate the map just run the script via the command line:

```console
user@seisPC:~$ ./Scan_SKS_SKKS_figs.gmt
```
In general, first you have to make the script executable via:
```console
user@seisPC:~$ chmod +x Scan_SKS_SKKS_figs.gmt
```

**Detailed information and instructions for the individual steps to generate the final figure can be found in the manual (pdf-file).**
