## GMT_gen_splittingDB

Script and files for plotting the content of the shear-wave splitting data base (**_Barruol et al., 2009; WÃ¼stefeld et al., 2009_**) on a global map. To generate the map (using the viridis colormap) just run the script via the command line:

```console
user@seisPC:~$ ./GMT_PLOT_splittingDB.gmt
```
In general, first you have to make the script executable via:
```console
user@seisPC:~$ chmod +x GMT_PLOT_splittingDB.gmt
```

**For further instructions (e.g. how to change the colormap) see the manual (pdf-file)**. Colormaps from the following sources are included in the download package:
