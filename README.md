# GMT-plotting
Collection of GMT (Generic Mapping Tools) scripts and files including digitized map content etc. All scripts should run with **GMT 5.2.1** or higher. Each directory in this repository represents a single stand-alone application (individual manuals in pdf format are included as well):

- [GMT_scan_SKS_SKKS_areas](#p1): visualizing of SKS-SKKS pierce point areas in the D" layer
- [GMT_scan_split_equidist_Siberia](#p22): plotting an equidistant map centered on NW Siberia (and raypaths)
- [GMT_scan_split_colorwheel](#p2): visualizing shear wave splitting results (color-coded with respect to source region)
- [GMT_scan_tectonic](#p3): visualizing geological and tectonic content of Fennoscandia

If you make use of the content in this repository please acknowledge GMT (e.g. **_Wessel et al., 2013_**) as well as my PhD thesis in whose framework several of the figures were developed:
