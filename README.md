# GMT-plotting
Collection of GMT (Generic Mapping Tools) scripts and files including digitized map content etc.
Each single directory represents a single stand-alone application.

If you make use of the content in this repository please acknowledge my PhD thesis in whose framework several of the figures were developed:

- Grund, M. (2019), Exploring geodynamics at different depths with shear wave splitting, Dissertation, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), https://doi.org/10.5445/IR/1000091425 
                        
### GMT_scan_tectonic

Script and files for visualizing geological and tectonic content of Fennoscandia (see final figure below). Content was partly digitised using Didger (R) (Golden Software, LLC) based on the following references:

Geological units are modified after Fig. 1 of:
- **HÃ¶gdahl et al. (2004)**, Geological Survey of Finland, Special Paper 37, The Transscandinavian Igneous Belt (TIB) in Sweden: a review of its character and evolution

Tornquist zone is modified from paper:
- **Wylegalla et al. (1999)**, Tectonophysics 314, Anisotropy across the Sorgenfrei-Tornquist Zone from shear wave splitting, https://doi.org/10.1016/S0040-1951(99)00252-8

Major shear zones, faults and inferred paleo-subduction zones are modified after Figs. 1 & 2 of:
- **Korja & Heikkinen (2005)**, Precambrian Research 136, 241-268 The accretionary Svecofennian orogen-insight from the BABEL profiles, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.precamres.2004.10.007
