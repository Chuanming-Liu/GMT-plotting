# GMT-plotting
Collection of GMT (Generic Mapping Tools) scripts and files including digitized map content etc. All scripts should run with **GMT 5.2.1** or higher. Each directory in this repository represents a single stand-alone application (individual manuals in pdf format are included as well):

- [GMT_gen_equidist_EQ](#p00): plotting global seismicity between 1960 and 2019 on equidistant map
- [GMT_scan_SKS_SKKS_areas](#p1): visualizing of SKS-SKKS pierce point areas in the D" layer
- [GMT_scan_SKS_SKKS_pierce_points](#p21): reproducing SKS-SKKS pierce point figures of Grund & Ritter (2019), Geology
- [GMT_scan_split_equidist_Siberia](#p22): plotting an equidistant map centered on NW Siberia (and raypaths)
- [GMT_scan_split_colorwheel](#p2): visualizing shear wave splitting results (color-coded with respect to source region)
- [GMT_scan_tectonic](#p3): visualizing geological and tectonic content of Fennoscandia

If you make use of the content in this repository please acknowledge GMT (e.g. **_Wessel et al., 2013_**) as well as my PhD thesis in whose framework several of the figures were developed:

### GMT_gen_equidist_EQ

Script and files for plotting the global seismicity between 01/01/1960 and 01/05/2019 on a map with equidistant projection.
The following colormaps are included in the download package:

  1) Scientific colormaps by F. Crameri (Zenodo. http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1243862)
    (see and download here: http://www.fabiocrameri.ch/colourmaps.php)

  2) MatPlotLib colormaps converted to GMT's cpt format (see and download here: http://soliton.vm.bytemark.co.uk/pub/cpt-city/mpl/index.html)
