# GMT-plotting
Collection of GMT (Generic Mapping Tools) scripts and files including digitized map content etc.
Each single directory represents a single stand-alone application.

If you make use of the content in this repository please acknowledge my PhD thesis in whose framework several of the figures were developed:

### [GMT_scan_SKS_SKKS_areas](#p1)

Script and files for visualizing SKS-SKKS pierce point areas in the D" layer around a network in Fennoscandia (see final figure below).

### [GMT_scan_split_colorwheel](#p2)

Script and files for visualizing shear wave splitting results (color-coded with respect to source region) in Fennoscandia (see final figure below).

### [GMT_scan_tectonic](#p3)

Script and files for visualizing geological and tectonic content of Fennoscandia (see final figure below). Content was partly digitised using Didger (R) (Golden Software, LLC) based on the following references:
