# GMT-plotting
Collection of GMT (Generic Mapping Tools) scripts and files including digitized map content etc. All scripts should run with **GMT 5.2.1** or higher. Each directory in this repository represents a single stand-alone application (individual manuals in pdf format are included as well):

- [GMT_gen_equidist_EQ](https://github.com/michaelgrund/GMT-plotting/tree/master/GMT_gen_equidist_EQ): plotting global seismicity between 1960 and 2019 on equidistant map
- [GMT_gen_seafloor_ages](https://github.com/michaelgrund/GMT-plotting/tree/master/GMT_gen_seafloor_ages): plotting the ages of oceanic lithosphere on a global map 
- [GMT_scan_SKS_SKKS_areas](https://github.com/michaelgrund/GMT-plotting/tree/master/GMT_scan_SKS_SKKS_areas): visualizing of SKS-SKKS pierce point areas in the D" layer
- [GMT_scan_SKS_SKKS_pierce_points](https://github.com/michaelgrund/GMT-plotting/tree/master/GMT_scan_SKS_SKKS_pierce_points): reproducing SKS-SKKS pierce point figures of Grund & Ritter (2019), Geology
- [GMT_scan_split_equidist_Siberia](https://github.com/michaelgrund/GMT-plotting/tree/master/GMT_scan_equidist_Siberia): plotting an equidistant map centered on NW Siberia (and raypaths)
- [GMT_scan_tectonic](https://github.com/michaelgrund/GMT-plotting/tree/master/GMT_scan_tectonic): visualizing geological and tectonic content of Fennoscandia

If you make use of the content in this repository please acknowledge GMT (e.g. **_Wessel et al., 2013_**) as well as my PhD thesis in whose framework several of the figures were developed:
