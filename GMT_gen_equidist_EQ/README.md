## GMT_gen_equidist_EQ

Script and files for plotting the global seismicity between 01/01/1960 and 01/05/2019 on a map with equidistant projection (see final figure and alternative color schemes below). Earthquake data is freely available and was downloaded from https://earthquake.usgs.gov.
Colormaps from (or based on) the following sources are included in the download package:

  1) Scientific colormaps by F. Crameri (Zenodo. http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1243862)
    (see and download here: http://www.fabiocrameri.ch/colourmaps.php)

  2) Matplotlib colormaps converted to GMT's cpt format (see and download here: http://soliton.vm.bytemark.co.uk/pub/cpt-city/mpl/index.html)

To generate the map (using the viridis colormap) just run the (executable) script via the command line:

```console
user@seisPC:~$ GMT_EQglob_BFO.gmt
```
